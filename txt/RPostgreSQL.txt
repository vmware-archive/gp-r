RPostgreSQL

The RPostgreSQL package provides a database interface and PostgreSQL driver for R that is compatible with the Greenplum database [RPostgreSQL]. This connection can be used to query the database in the normal fashion from within R code. We have found this package to be helpful for prototyping, working with datasets that can fit in-memory, and building visualizations. Generally speaking, using the RPostgreSQL interface does not lend itself to parallelization.  

Using RPostgreSQL has 3 steps: (i) create a database driver for PostgreSQL, (ii) connect to a specific database (iii) execute the query on GPDB and return results. 

1) Local development
RPostgreSQL can be used in a local development environment to connect to a remote GPDB instance. Queries are processed in parallel on GPDB and results are returned in the familiar R data frame format. Use caution when returning large resultsets as you may run into the memory limitations of your local R instance. To ease troubleshooting, it can be helpful to develop/debug the SQL using your GPDB tool of choice (e.g. pgAdmin) before using it in R. 

	DBNAME = 'marketing'
	HOST   = '10.110.134.123'

	# Create a driver
	drv <- dbDriver( "PostgreSQL" )
	# Create the database connection
	con <- dbConnect( drv, dbname = DBNAME, host = HOST )

	# Create the SQL query string. Include a semi-colon to terminate
	querystring = 	'SELECT countryname, income, babies FROM country_table;'
	# Execute the query and return results as a data frame
	countries 	= dbGetQuery( con, querystring )

	# Plot the results
	plot( countries$income, countries$babies )


2) PL/R Usage
RPostgreSQL can also be used from within a PL/R function and deployed on the host GPDB instance. This bypasses the PL/R pipe for data exchange in favor of the DBI driver used by RPostgreSQL. In certain tests we have found the RPostgreSQL data exchange to be faster than the PL/R interface [NOTE: We should explore/verify this claim]. The primary benefit of using this interface over the standard PL/R interface is that datatype conversions happen automatically; one need not specify all of the columns and their datatypes to pass to the function ahead of time. Sensible conversions are done automatically, including conversion of strings to factors which can be helpful in downstream processes. 

While RPostgreSQL can be quite useful in a development context, don't be fooled. It is not a good path towards actual parallelization of your R code. Because the code in the PL/R function accesses database objects it cannot safely be called in a distributed manner. This will lead to errors such as:

	DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS my_plr_error_func( character );
	CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION my_plr_error_func( character ) 
	RETURNS INTEGER AS 
	$$
	  library("RPostgreSQL")

	  drv <- dbDriver( "PostgreSQL" )
	  con <- dbConnect( drv, dbname = arg1 )

	  querystring = 'SELECT reviewid FROM sample_model_data;'
	  model.data  = dbGetQuery( con, querystring )

	  16
	$$
	LANGUAGE 'plr';

	-- This returns without error but does not run in parallel
	SELECT my_plr_error_func( 'zimmen' );
	
	-- This produces the error below
	SELECT my_plr_error_func( 'zimmen' ) FROM sample_model_data;

	********** Error **********

	ERROR: R interpreter expression evaluation error  (seg55 slice1 sdw3:40001 pid=1676)
	SQL state: 22000
	Detail: 
		 Error in pg.spi.exec(sql) : 
	  error in SQL statement : function cannot execute on segment because it accesses relation "public.sample_model_data"
		 In R support function pg.spi.exec
	In PL/R function my_plr_error_func

GPDB is complaining because you are trying to access a table directly from a segment, which breaks the whole notion of coordination between the master node and its segments. Therefore, you cannot specify a from clause in your PL/R function when you make an RPostgreSQL call from within that function. 

ALTERNATIVE
For the adventerous, the RPostgreSQL package provides more granular control over execution. An equivalent to dbGetQuery is to first submit the SQL to the database engine using dbSendQuery and then fetch the results: 

drv <- dbDriver( "PostgreSQL" )
con <- dbConnect( drv )
res <- dbSendQuery( con, "SELECT * FROM sample_model_data;" )
data <- fetch( res, n = -1 ) 

Note that the fetch function has a parameter, n, which sets the maximum number of records to retrieve. You probably always want to set this value to -1 to retrieve all of the records. I'm not sure why you would ever use this instead of the simpler dbGetQuery.
